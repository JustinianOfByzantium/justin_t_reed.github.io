                    <p> This is me standing next to Cristopher Woo back in 2017 after our team won the Cal State Chess Championship.
                      Cristopher Woo would later go on to become the youngest Grandmaster in America. I never became Grandmaster myself (or even close, for that matter),
                      but chess is still something I enjoy playing as a hobby. I'm currently rated 1850 in rapid on Chess.com.</p>

                    I also enjoy biking and swimming and hope to soon compete in a triathlon.</p>

                    <p> This is me standing in front of the Confucius Institute in San Francisco after participating in a caligraphy competition for non-native Chinese speakers.
                        I more or less won by default because there hardly are any non-native Chinese speakers! It's a very difficult language, but I really enjoy learning it. I'm quite interested in Chinese history and culture &mdash;
                      I've been to China twice and hope to go again. I minored in Chinese as an undergraduate and am still actively studying the language as much as I can, reading Chinese news articles and having conversations with my Chinese friends.
