                    <p> This is me standing next to Cristopher Yoo back in 2017 after our team won the Cal State Chess Championship.
                      Cristopher Yoo would later go on to become the youngest Grandmaster in America. I never became Grandmaster myself (or even close, for that matter),
                      but chess is still something I enjoy playing as a hobby. I'm currently rated 1850 in rapid on Chess.com.</p>

                    I also enjoy biking and swimming and hope to soon compete in a triathlon.</p>

                    <p> This is me standing in front of the Confucius Institute in San Francisco after participating in a caligraphy competition for non-native Chinese speakers.
                        I more or less won by default because there hardly are any non-native Chinese speakers! It's a very difficult language, but I really enjoy learning it. I'm quite interested in Chinese history and culture &mdash;
                      I've been to China twice and hope to go again. I minored in Chinese as an undergraduate and am still actively studying the language as much as I can, reading Chinese news articles and having conversations with my Chinese friends.

                    <p> Here I am inside of the Bike Share Basement at Haverford College. I helped restart the bike share program on campus,
                      growing our fleet of bikes from 5 to 50. It was a fun weekly project where we fixed up old bikes for students to use at no cost. Once I graduated I left the program in capable hands, 
                      now my interest in biking is purely recreational. I enjoy mountain biking and long distance road cycling. Recently I did a trip where I biked all the way from Cleveland to Annapolis on the Gap Trail, biking 
                      600 miles over the course of nine days.
