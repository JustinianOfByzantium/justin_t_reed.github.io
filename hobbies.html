                  <p> This is me in San Francisco after participating in a caligraphy competition for non-native Chinese speakers.
                      I more or less won by default because there hardly are any non-native Chinese speakers! It's a very difficult language, but I really enjoy learning it. I'm quite interested in Chinese history and culture &mdash;
                    I've been to China twice and hope to go again. I minored in Chinese as an undergraduate and am still actively studying the language as much as I can, reading Chinese news articles and having conversations with my Chinese friends.

                  <p> Here I am inside of the Bike Share Basement at Haverford College. I revived the bike share program on campus,
                    growing the fleet of bikes from 5 to 50. It was a fun weekly project where we fixed up old bikes for students to use at no cost. Once I graduated I left the program in capable hands, 
                    now my interest in biking is purely recreational. I enjoy mountain biking and long distance road cycling. Recently I did a trip where I biked all the way from Cleveland to Annapolis on the Gap Trail, biking 
                    600 miles over the course of nine days.

                  <p> I have been fascinated by geography since I was very young. I had a huge collection of atlases and maps that I 
                    would copy by hand, eventually becoming good enough to reproduce these maps entirely from memory. As I became older,
                    my interest in geography became more data-driven. This motivated me to start a <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/@CartographerJustinian/featured"> YouTube page</a> 
                    where I made videos on a variety of geography related subjects, where I gained 2.5k subscribers and over 400k views. 
                    More recently, I've leveraged this interest in a more professional setting in my <a href = https://www.linkedin.com/posts/justin-t-reed_excited-to-announce-that-ive-started-a-new-activity-7389353139285413890-kwU3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADzZMXQBkFGKPoN1s9lIKZbTvaJDtP2BBoU> 
                    Research Assistant role</a> at the University of Pennsylvania, where I process large amounts of geospatial data for training ecological risk machine
                    learning models.
