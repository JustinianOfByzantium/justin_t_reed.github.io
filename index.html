              My main academic interests consist of <strong> systems programming </strong> and <strong> high-scale data analytics</strong>, 
              the combination of which is crucial for supporting modern AI systems.

                I love tackling problems with <strong>complex, interconnected components</strong>. First as an undergraduate at Haverford,
                I completed a Bachelor's in Computer Science while also minoring in Economics and Chinese. This breadth of subject area forced 
                me to constantly adapt my approach to problem solving. For example, I was a coding teaching assistant for Intermediate 
                Microeconomics, where I mentored students in how to bring a quantitative angle to a subject that is often quite 
                ambiguous. I also brought this mindset to my activities outside of class, such as when 
                <a href = "/hobbies.html#bike-share">I revived the bike share program on campus</a>, coordinating with donors,
                students, administrators, vendors, and community members to provide an essential service to my college. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Now as a Master's student at the <strong>University of Pennsylvania</strong>, I've applied this interest in a setting with serious
                technical depth. As part of my computer science degree, I've taken rigourous systems courses such as <strong>Internet and Web Systems,
                Networked Systems, Operating Systems, and Databases</strong>. Each of these courses have involved serious hands-on projects. For example,
                <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/justin-t-reed_backendengineering-distributedsystems-searchengine-activity-7411922794407493633-rksS?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADzZMXQBkFGKPoN1s9lIKZbTvaJDtP2BBoU">
                <strong>I built a web search engine from scratch</strong></a>, which required careful thinking about scalability tradeoffs as I deployed my engine to <strong>EC2</strong>.
                Links to all of my most impressive projects can be found <a href="/projects.html">here</a>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Outside of these systems courses, I've also benefited from a strong theoretical foundation in the math behind computer science,
                taking courses in <strong>Probability, Convex Optimization, Algorithms, and Machine Learning</strong>. Each of these courses has strengthened
                my mathematical depth while helping me develop a creative approach to problem solving. For example, I leveraged neural networks
                to solve a unique problem in Chinese language translation, which has been an interest of mine as a student of the language. You 
                can learn more about it <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nfS9N-1yFVgySLeUu7FmazXtIuB2rMzL/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.

                Most recently, I work as a <strong>research assistant</strong> at the University of Pennsylvania, where I process geospatial data pipelines used
                for machine learning with Python and Google Cloud. I am graduating in May and <strong>looking for full time software engineering jobs
                with a backend focus</strong>. If you know of any opportunities and are interested in getting in touch, you can reach out to me on
