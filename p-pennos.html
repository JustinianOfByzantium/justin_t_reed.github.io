                        <h1> PennOS: a UNIX-like operating system </h1>

                        <p> 
                            PennOS functions as a fully realized UNIX-like operating system simulator 
                            running as a single guest process on a host OS. The architecture successfully maintained a strict abstraction 
                            between user land and kernel land by utilizing specific function prefixes: <em> u_ </em> for user-level, <em> s_</em> for system calls, 
                            and <em> k_ </em> for kernel-level operations. While the kernel managed process lifecycles and a priority scheduler driven by 
                            100ms clock ticks, the core of the data management relied on the PennFAT subsystem.
                        
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            I implemented the PennFAT subsystem as a robust, FAT-based file system contained entirely within a single large 
                            file on the host machine. I designed it to handle all file operations within a single top-level directory, allowing 
                            for the creation, modification, and deletion of files. To ensure modularity and prevent the code from becoming a mess, 
                            I relied on internal kernel-level helpers such as k_write for generic file writing and k_get_block to retrieve specific 
                            block numbers. This structure allowed the OS to mount the file system in a loop-back manner, providing a stable storage 
                            layer for all user-level programs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I achieved integration between the file system and the rest of the OS through a global file descriptor table and 
                            specific system calls. To maintain the integrity of the system, I ensured that user-level programs like the 
                            shell were strictly forbidden from bypassing my PennFAT implementation via host OS calls like read(); instead, 
                            they interacted with my storage layer through authorized interfaces like s_read. This ensured that every byte 
                            written to the simulated disk was managed correctly by my PennFAT logic, supporting complex shell features such as 
                            stdin/stdout redirection.
                        </p>
